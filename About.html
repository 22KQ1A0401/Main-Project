        <h3><p>Every page on your baking business website is a place to attract new cake orders, and the about page is a great opportunity <br>
            to connect with your customers by giving them a chance to get to know you.  It’s important that you don’t cram your website<br>
            full of text and information as it can overwhelm potential customers and they may leave the website before they see what you <br>
            think about my website it is beatiful and simple website.it’s important to be selective and strategic about what you do   <br>
            The rest of your website will be selling your beautiful baking but on your about page, you’re going to sell yourself.<br>
            he first paragraph should be a brief and succinct couple of sentences summing up what you offer and who you serve.  Here<br>
            you are trying to grab the attention of potential customers, telling them they are in the right place and have found the<br>
            right baker for them.Potential cake customers want to know they are buying from someone who really cakes about the product,<br>
            so in this section you should talk about why you love what you do.  Talk about why you love to bake in general, and why you<br>
            picked the niche you bake in now.  When people can feel your love and passion for what you do, it will become infectious<br> 
            and they will want to support you and buy from you!
